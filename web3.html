<body><h1>CATS</h1>
    <p>
        A cat—scientifically known as Felis catus—is a small, carnivorous mammal that has been living alongside humans for thousands of years. It’s part of the Felidae family, which also includes lions, tigers, and leopards, but the domestic cat is the only one that’s been truly tamed for companionship.
Cats are known for their agility, sharp retractable claws, keen senses (especially hearing and night vision), and a strong instinct to hunt. Despite their reputation for independence, many cats form deep bonds with their humans. They communicate through a mix of vocalizations—like meows, purrs, and hisses—and body language, such as tail flicks or ear positions.
Interestingly, cats were likely first domesticated around 7500 BC in the Near East, not Egypt as many believe. Early farmers appreciated their knack for controlling rodent populations, and over time, cats became beloved companions and even sacred animals in some cultures.
